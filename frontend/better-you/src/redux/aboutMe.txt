This folder will contain the whole redux architecture:

/actions
types.ts - the type of the actions (consts and interfaces)
actions.ts - the actions (functions) that will be dispatched when an event occurs
           - they will be type-checked with the prev types

/reducers - contains the reducers for each action
          - for better clarity we can have the handlers for each reducer in another file

/sagas - folder for saga middleware
       - a file with sagas and a file with listeners (will have an instance of HttpService)
       - not part of redux, but we need a middleware between this and back-end

/store
store.ts - the global state of the app (preferably completed setted from start)
configure-store.ts - file to configure the store
                   - it is setted the middleware, the reducer and built the store
